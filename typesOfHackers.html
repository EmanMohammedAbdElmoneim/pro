<h1>1. White Hat Hackers</h1>
    <img src="images/baseball-cap.png" style="float: right;">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Meet the right guys on the dark web. White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers are the cybersecurity experts who help the Govt and organizations by performing penetration testing and identifying loopholes in their cybersecurity. They even do other methodologies and ensure protection from black hat hackers and other malicious cyber crimes.

            Simply stated, these are the right people who are on your side. They will hack into your system with the good intention of finding vulnerabilities and help you remove virus and malware from your system.</p>
        <h1>2. Black Hat Hackers</h1>
        <img src="images/baseball-cap-1.png" style="float: right;">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Taking credit for the negative persona around "hacking," these guys are your culprits. A black hat hacker is the type of hacker you should be worried. Heard a news about a new cybercrime today? One of the black hat hackers may be behind it.

While their agenda may be monetary most of the time, it's not always just that. These hackers look for vulnerabilities in individual PCs, organizations and bank systems. Using any loopholes they may find, they can hack into your network and get access to your personal, business and financial information.</p>
        <h1>3. Gray Hat Hackers</h1>
        <img src="images/baseball-cap-2.png" style="float: right;">
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Gray hat hackers fall somewhere in between white hat and black hat hackers. While they may not use their skills for personal gain, they can, however, have both good and bad intentions. For instance, a hacker who hacks into an organization and finds some vulnerability may leak it over the Internet or inform the organization about it.

It all depends upon the hacker. Nevertheless, as soon as hackers use their hacking skills for personal gain they become black hat hackers. There is a fine line between these two. So, let me make it simple for you.


Because a gray hat hacker doesn't use his skills for personal gain, he is not a black hat hacker. Also, because he is not legally authorized to hack the organization's cybersecurity, he can't be considered a white hat either.

</p>
<h1>4. Script Kiddies</h1>
        <img src="images/script.png" style="float: right;">
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">A derogatory term often used by amateur hackers who don't care much about the coding skills. These hackers usually download tools or use available hacking codes written by other developers and hackers. Their primary purpose is often to impress their friends or gain attention.

However, they don't care about learning. By using off-the-shelf codes and tools, these hackers may launch some attacks without bothering for the quality of the attack. Most common cyber attacks by script kiddies might include DoS and DDoS attacks.

</p>
<h1>5. Green Hat Hackers</h1>
        <img src="images/baseball-cap-3.png" style="float: right;">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">These hackers are the amateurs in the online world of hacking. Consider them script kiddies but with a difference. These newbies have a desire to become full-blown hackers and are very curious to learn. You may find them engrossed in the hacking communities bombarding their fellow hackers with questions.

You can identify them by their spark to grow and learn more about the hacking trade. Once you answer a single question, the hackers will listen with undivided attention and ask another question until you answer all their queries</p>
